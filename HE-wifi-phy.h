 * This PHY implements a model of 802.11a. The model

 * in "Yet Another Network Simulator",
 * (http://cutebugs.net/files/wns2-HE.pdf).
 *
 *
 * This PHY model depends on a channel loss and delay
 * model as provided by the ns3::PropagationLossModel
 * and ns3::PropagationDelayModel classes, both of which are
 * members of the ns3::HEWifiChannel class.
